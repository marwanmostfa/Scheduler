# CPU-Scheduler
## Implementation of OS Scheduling Algorithms

### Inputs :
Type of scheduler + no of Processes + required information about each process
according to the scheduler type.
<br/>
### Output:
Time line showing the order and time taken by each process (Gantt Chart) +
Average waiting time.<br/>
### Types of schedulers supported:
1. FCFS
2. SJF (Preemptive and Non Preemptive)
3. Priority (Preemptive and Non Preemptive) (the smaller the priority number the
higher the priority)
4. Round Robin
